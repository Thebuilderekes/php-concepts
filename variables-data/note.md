# Variables

- variables are case sensitive
- variables always begin with a $ sign
- don't use numbers after the $ sign
- it doesn't hat matter of white space that you use when giving value to a variable.

## Variable Types

PHP has no command for declaring a variable, and the data type depends on the value of the variable.

## variable scope

Variables declared inside a function are local scoped and cannot be accessed from outside the function,
likewise vaiables in the global scope cannot be accesde from within a function unless you use the `global`
keyword within the function.

## comments

- Avoid the use of backslashes
  \*\*only letters, underscore are allowed to be used after the $ sign
