- Asbstract class defines an interface for the the parent that will be passed on to child classes.

- You cannot create an instant of an abstract class. An abstract class can only be used by an instantiation of a child class that extends the parent class.

- When using an abstract method in the parent class, the visibility on the method, ```private, public or protected``` of the child class must match that of the abstract method on the parent class.
