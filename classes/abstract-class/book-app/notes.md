- The parent keyword allows you satisfy the presence of the other properties used in the child constructor that are part of the parent Book class constructor properties. This is a must whenever we use properties in child classes that has unique properties that concern only that child alongside that of its parents.

- Parent classes do not access methods in the child classes but child classes has access to methods in their parent classes.
